# FAQ
## Que. Gallery images are not displaying ?
**Ans.** Increase memory limit and execution time limit (maximum the better). Vuedisk generates thumbnails when you open that directory. Therefore it could be slow ( or may be very slow). When you click on any image thumbnail, then it generates another image thumbnail.

This is because lets say I have an Image whose size is 10 MB. So at first it generates image of height 320px (~ 150 KB). When you click on that image, it generates image of height 720px (~ 2MB). And when you click download button, it downloads original image (10 MB).

Also it would be better if you use SSD storage.
